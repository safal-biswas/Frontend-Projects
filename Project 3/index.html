          <h1>Dune</h1>
          <small>Frank Herbert</small>

        <p>
          Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank
          Herbert, originally published as two separate serials (1963â€“64 novel
          Dune World and 1965 novel Prophet of Dune) in Analog magazine. It tied
          with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award for Best Novel
          and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966. It is the
          first installment of the Dune Chronicles. It is one of the world's
          best-selling science fiction novels. Dune is set in the distant future
          in a feudal interstellar society, descended from terrestrial humans,
          in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs. It tells the
          story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of
          the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely
          populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or
          "spice", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities.
          Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind
          of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug
          provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the
          planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the
          multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology,
          and human emotion as the factions of the empire confront each other in
          a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.

        <p>
          Duke Leto Atreides of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean world
          Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as
          fief ruler of the planet Arrakis. Although Arrakis is a harsh and
          inhospitable desert planet, it is of enormous importance because it is
          the only planetary source of melange, or the "spice", a unique and
          incredibly valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and
          lifespan. It is also through the consumption of spice that Spacing
          Guild Navigators are able to effect safe interstellar travel. The
          Emperor, jealous of the Duke's rising popularity in the Landsraad,
          sees House Atreides as a potential future rival and threat, so he
          conspires with House Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and the
          longstanding enemies of the Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family
          after their arrival. Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some
          kind but is compelled to obey the Emperor's orders anyway. Leto's
          concubine Lady Jessica is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an
          exclusively female group that pursues mysterious political aims and
          wields seemingly superhuman physical and mental abilities, such as the
          ability to control their bodies down to the cellular level, and also
          decide the sex of their children. Though Jessica was instructed by the
          Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter as part of their breeding program,
          out of love for Leto she bore a son, Paul. From a young age, Paul is
          trained in warfare by Leto's aides, the elite soldiers Duncan Idaho
          and Gurney Halleck. Thufir Hawat, the Duke's Mentat (human computers,
          able to store vast amounts of data and perform advanced calculations
          on demand), has instructed Paul in the ways of political intrigue.
